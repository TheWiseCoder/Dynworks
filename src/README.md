## Dynarrays and Dynvectors in Prolog

Please, find a comprehensive tutorial on using dynarrays in the folder *dynarray-tutorial*. Additionally, in the folder *dynvector-benchmark* we present a beginner's tutorial on using *dynvectors*, and demonstrate the enormous performance gains they provide when used as replacements for standard Prolog lists.

The implementation includes modules providing persistence for instances of both *dynarrays* and *dynvectors*, using the Berkeley DB library. The tutorial in the folder *dynarray_tutorial* illustrates persisting and restoring *dynarrays*.
